# Introduction — OWASP Top Ten

The **[OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)** is a widely recognized, community-driven awareness document that summarizes the most critical security risks to web applications. It helps developers, security teams, and organizations prioritize defensive efforts by describing common vulnerability categories, their impact, and high-level mitigation guidance.

Below is a concise list of the categories (latest common framing), each with a short description:

1. **Broken Access Control** — Failures in enforcing user permissions allow attackers to access unauthorized functions or data.  
2. **Cryptographic Failures** — Inadequate protection of sensitive data through weak or missing encryption and poor key management.  
3. **Injection** — Untrusted input sent to interpreters (e.g., SQL, OS, LDAP) leading to execution of unintended commands.  
4. **Insecure Design** — Architectural or design flaws that enable security weaknesses before code is written.  
5. **Security Misconfiguration** — Incorrect or default configurations that expose the application or infrastructure.  
6. **Vulnerable and Outdated Components** — Use of libraries, frameworks, or modules with known vulnerabilities.  
7. **Identification and Authentication Failures** — Weak authentication, session management, or credential handling.  
8. **Software and Data Integrity Failures** — Lack of integrity checks allowing tampered code or data to be accepted.  
9. **Security Logging and Monitoring Failures** — Insufficient logging or alerting that prevents timely detection and response.  
10. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** — Server-side fetching of untrusted URLs that can access internal systems or sensitive resources.
